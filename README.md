# 1-logistic_regression_classifier_from_scratch
End-to-end data analysis project using a logistic regression classifier implemented from scratch.

## Abstract


A logistic regression classifier has been implemented in two versions: one based on the method of Loss
Minimization through Gradient Descent; the other based on Likelihood Maximization through Gradient
Ascent. The algorithms have been applied to two datasets: Hepatitis and Bankruptcy. Different techniques
of data analysis have been applied to the data. Experiments have been conducted to determine the balance
between accuracy and running time by changing the relative tolerance of the algorithms and the learning
rate. Further feature engineering has been applied to the data in order to increase the obtained accuracy of
the models
